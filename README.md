<p > This is a basic  <strong> "React" </strong> application to practice myself. You can test yourself by cloning the project. Since there is also a Json-Server, you should type "npm run dev" to access application on your local after cloning.<br><br> The reason of using Json-Server in that project is that when you add or delete a feedback from the application, it comes back after refreshing the browser (Since React is only a UI Library). To avoid that, we should store our data into a backend server. In that way, we can delete or add feedback permanently from our application.
